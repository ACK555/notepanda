Just practice XD

🚧 WIP

## Why write this text editor?

I recently started getting started with Qt, this is my first Qt project, the first C++ project, and the first project in my life. I hope to develop my skills through this project.

I'm not going to use this as a replacement for my other text editors because it's too simple and I am too poor :)

So enjoy this toy 🍵️
